<p>
    I am an independent inclusive design engineer, author, speaker, and trainer based in Lebanon.
     I love the Web platform and I want to make it better for everyone. And I consider myself to be completely blessed that I get to build it for a living.

        <h1>work</h1>
        <p>I work with companies and agencies around the world, building Web user interfaces, design systems, and digital products with focus on responsive design, accessibility, performance, and cutting-edge tech. I’ve worked with teams at companies like SuperFriendly, Herman Miller, Khan Academy, Bosch, and more.

            I also speak and run workshops across the globe, covering practical insights and tried and true practices for building scalable, resilient front-end foundations. Since 2014, I’ve presented and delivered Keynotes at dozens of events worldwide, and have led workshops at conferences, as well as in-house for companies like Netflix, Telus, and the Royal Schiphol Group at Amsterdam Airport.
            
            I wrote the Codrops CSS Reference, and co-authored the Smashing Book 5 — a book that covers time-saving, practical techniques for crafting fast, maintainable and scalable responsive websites.
            
            Awards and recognition
            In 2015, I was voted Developer of the Year in the net awards, and shortlisted for the Outstanding Contribution of the Year award. I also won an O’Reilly Web Platform Award — an award that recognizes individuals who have demonstrated “exceptional leadership, creativity, and collaboration in the development of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and the supporting Web ecosystem.”
